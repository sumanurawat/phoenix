## I Fixed the Tailwind Error!

The PostCSS error is now resolved. Just refresh:

## What You'll See Right Now:

At http://localhost:5173 you'll see the default Vite + React template because we haven't built the SOHO components yet.

**This is normal!** We need to build the components first.

## Want to See SOHO Working?

Let me build a quick test page to show you the design system!

Just say "yes" and I'll create a basic SOHO page with:
- Dark theme

Should take ~5 minutes!
