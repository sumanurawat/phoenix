# Quick Fix Summary: Veo API "No Video Outputs" Error

**Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Issue:** `RuntimeError: Generation completed but no video outputs were returned`  
**Status:** Enhanced logging deployed, awaiting production logs

## What Was Changed

### ✅ Added Comprehensive Logging
- **Request logging**: See exactly what we're sending to the API
- **Response logging**: See the full API response structure
- **Error detection**: Catch API errors that were previously missed

### ✅ Added Fallback Support
- Check for alternative response formats (`predictions` field)
- Handle different video output structures

### ✅ Improved Error Messages
- Show GCS URIs, video bytes count, and local paths
- Clear indication that it might be an API format issue

## How to Debug

### 1. Check Production Logs
Run the log check task or use:
```bash
./venv/bin/python scripts/fetch_logs.py --hours 1 --severity ERROR
```

Look for these new log entries:
- `WARNING: Veo operation completed but no videos in response`
- `ERROR: Full operation response: {...}`
- `INFO: Operation metadata: {...}`

### 2. Analyze the Response
The full operation response will show:
- What fields are actually in the response
- Any error messages from the API
- The structure we need to parse

### 3. Common Issues to Check

| Issue | What to Look For | Fix |
|-------|------------------|-----|
| **Permission Error** | `error.message` contains "permission denied" | Grant storage access to service account |
| **Quota Exceeded** | `error.message` contains "quota" or "rate limit" | Request quota increase or wait |
| **Wrong Format** | Response has `predictions` instead of `videos` | Update parsing logic |
| **Storage Issue** | `error.message` contains "storage" or "bucket" | Verify bucket exists and has correct permissions |

## Files Modified
- `services/veo_video_generation_service.py` - Enhanced response parsing
- `services/reel_generation_service.py` - Better error logging

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to production** ✅ (use GitHub push to main)
2. **Trigger test generation** - Create a new reel project and generate
3. **Review logs** - Check Cloud Logging for the new debug info
4. **Update code** - Based on what the logs reveal
5. **Document solution** - Update this file with the fix
