## 🚀 NEXT STEPS TO LAUNCH

### Immediate (To Test Full Flow):

**Option A: Generate a Test Video**
```bash
# 1. Go to http://localhost:8080/video-generation
# 2. Enter prompt: "A serene sunset over mountains"
# 3. Generate video (costs 10 tokens)
# 4. Wait for worker to process
# 5. Publish video
# 6. Check /explore - video should appear
```

**Option B: Deploy to Production First**
Since all code is working, you can deploy now and test in production:

```bash
# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml

# This deploys both:
# - phoenix-api-server (your Flask app)
# - phoenix-video-worker (Celery worker for video generation)
```

### Wait for Firestore Index
The composite index for `creations` is building. You can monitor it here:
https://console.firebase.google.com/project/phoenix-project-386/firestore/indexes

Once it shows "Enabled" (usually 5-15 minutes), the explore feed will work perfectly.

## ⏰ INDEX BUILD WAIT TIME

**Current Status:** Firestore is building the composite index for the explore feed query.

**How to Check:**
1. Visit: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/phoenix-project-386/firestore/indexes
2. Look for index on `creations` collection
3. Status will change: Building → Enabled (5-15 minutes)

**What to Do While Waiting:**
1. ✅ Generate a test video (so there's content to show on explore)
2. ✅ Test username claiming with a second account
3. ✅ Review deployment configuration
4. ✅ Prepare Stripe live mode settings
5. ✅ Write launch announcement

## 🐛 DEBUGGING GUIDE

### If Username Not Working:
```python
# Check Firestore
firebase_console = "https://console.firebase.google.com/project/phoenix-project-386/firestore"
# Look at:
# - users/{userId} - should have "username" field
# - usernames/{username} - should exist with userId
```

### If Explore Feed Errors:
```bash
# Check index status
open https://console.firebase.google.com/project/phoenix-project-386/firestore/indexes

# Check logs
tail -f /tmp/phoenix_app.log | grep explore

# Test API directly
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/feed/explore?limit=5'
```

### If Likes Not Working:
```bash
# Ensure user is logged in
# Check browser console for errors
# Verify API response:
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/creations/CREATION_ID/like' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -b cookies.txt
```
