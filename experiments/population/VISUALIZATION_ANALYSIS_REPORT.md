# üåç Population Visualization Analysis & Recommendations

**Analysis Date:** 2025-07-09  
**Analyzed by:** Claude AI Assistant  
**Project:** Phoenix Population Experiment  

## Executive Summary

Your population experiment shows a solid foundation with professional visualization components, but has significant opportunities for improvement in interactivity and user engagement. The current implementation provides good static visualizations but lacks the "complete solution" with interactive time controls and dynamic axis exploration you're seeking.

## Current State Analysis
