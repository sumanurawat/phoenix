    *   When a job page is identified, query the backend using extracted identifiers (URL, Job ID, or Company + Title combination).
    *   Check against the user's tracked applications in the database.
    *   If a likely match is found, display a clear, non-intrusive notification within the extension (e.g., "Warning: You applied to a similar role at [Company] on [Date].").
*   `4.3.4. On-Demand Document Generation:`
    *   Allow user to trigger CV or Cover Letter generation via the extension UI.
    *   Send extracted job description context and relevant user profile data (selected experiences/skills or full profile) to the backend AI service.
    *   Backend generates a tailored document draft.
    *   Display the generated draft in the extension for user review, copying, or download.

### 4.4. Application Tracking (Integrated: Extension & Web App)
*   `4.4.1. Application Logging:`
    *   Provide a simple way within the extension (e.g., "Track this Application" button) to save the details of a job the user is applying to/has applied to (pre-filled with extracted Job Title, Company, URL, current date).
    *   Allow manual entry/editing of applications via the Web App.
*   `4.4.2. Status Management:` Users can assign and update statuses for each tracked application (e.g., Wishlist, Applied, Interviewing [specify stage], Offer Received, Offer Accepted, Offer Declined, Rejected, Withdrawn) via the Web App.
*   `4.4.3. Application Dashboard (Web App):` Provide a centralized view (e.g., list or Kanban board) of all tracked applications, filterable and sortable by status, date applied, company, etc. Include basic counts (e.g., X applications this week).

### 4.5. AI-Powered Interview Preparation (Web App)
*   `4.5.1. Conversational Interface:` Provide a chat interface where users can interact with their stored career data.
*   `4.5.2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):` The backend retrieves relevant sections of the user's profile (projects, skills, narratives based on keywords in the query) and uses them, along with the user's question, to prompt an LLM.
*   `4.5.3. Use Cases:` Support queries like:
    *   Generating STAR-format behavioral answers ("Tell me about a time...").
    *   Summarizing experience with specific skills/technologies ("Summarize my experience with React").
    *   Recalling details of specific projects ("What were the key challenges in Project X?").

### 4.6. Community/Market Insights (Web App - V1.x / V2)
*   `4.6.1. Aggregated Data Display:` *Subject to data availability and privacy considerations*, display anonymized, aggregated statistics related to job postings encountered by the user community. Examples could include:
    *   Relative number of users who have tracked applications for similar roles/companies (anonymized count).
    *   Potentially, aggregated application timelines (e.g., average time from application to first response, anonymized).
*   `4.6.2. Data Sourcing:` Primarily relies on aggregating anonymized data from users who opt-in to contributing their application tracking activity. Requires robust anonymization and clear user consent mechanisms. *Direct scraping of external sites is explicitly out of scope for V1 due to technical and legal complexities.*
*   `4.6.3. Job Postings Table:` A backend table (`JobPostings`) will store unique job identifiers encountered across the user base to facilitate aggregation, distinct from the user-specific `Applications` table.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **5.1. Security:** Industry-standard practices for authentication, data encryption (at rest, in transit), API security, dependency management, and protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, Injection). Secure handling of third-party API keys (AI service).
*   **5.2. Privacy:** GDPR/CCPA compliance (as applicable). Clear privacy policy outlining data usage. User control over their data. Explicit consent required for any data aggregation/sharing, even anonymized. Minimal Chrome extension permissions requested.
*   **5.3. Performance:** Web app and extension UI load quickly. Backend API responds promptly (<500ms for typical requests, longer acceptable for AI generation). Extension operation has negligible impact on browser performance. Efficient database queries.
*   **5.4. Usability:** Intuitive and clean UI/UX for both web app and extension. Easy data entry and navigation. Clear feedback and error messaging. Minimal friction in core workflows (tracking, filling, generating).
*   **5.5. Reliability:** High availability of backend services (>99.5% uptime). Robust parsing and form-filling logic resilient to minor changes in common job site layouts (best-effort). Graceful degradation if AI service is unavailable.
*   **5.6. Scalability:** Architecture designed to handle growth in users, data volume, and request load. Stateless backend services where possible. Database optimized for common query patterns.
*   **5.7. Maintainability:** Well-documented, modular codebase adhering to good programming practices. Automated testing (unit, integration).

## 6. Release Criteria / Phasing
