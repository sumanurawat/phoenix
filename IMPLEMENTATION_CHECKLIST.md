## ⏳ Next Steps (Testing Phase)

### Phase 1: Create Cloud Build Trigger
```bash
# Run this command to create the trigger
gcloud builds triggers create github \
  --name="reel-stitching-job-deploy" \
  --description="Auto-deploy video stitching job on code changes" \
  --repo-name="phoenix" \
  --repo-owner="sumanurawat" \
  --branch-pattern="^main$" \
  --build-config="jobs/video_stitching/cloudbuild.yaml" \
  --included-files="jobs/video_stitching/**" \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --project=phoenix-project-386
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Created [https://cloudbuild.googleapis.com/v1/projects/phoenix-project-386/locations/us-central1/triggers/reel-stitching-job-deploy].
NAME: reel-stitching-job-deploy
```

**Verification**:
```bash
gcloud builds triggers describe reel-stitching-job-deploy --region=us-central1
```

### Phase 2: Test Automated Deployment

#### Step 1: Make Test Change
```bash
# Add a comment or small change to trigger deployment
echo "# Test deployment automation" >> jobs/video_stitching/main.py
```

#### Step 2: Commit and Push
```bash
git add jobs/video_stitching/main.py
git commit -m "test: verify automated deployment for video stitching job"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 3: Monitor Build
```bash
# Watch build status (should start within 10-30 seconds)
watch -n 5 'gcloud builds list --limit=1 --format="table(id,status,createTime)"'

# Or view in Cloud Console
open "https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=phoenix-project-386"
```

#### Step 4: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check job was updated (generation number should increment)
gcloud run jobs describe reel-stitching-job \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --format="value(status.observedGeneration,metadata.generation)"

# Check deployment logs
gcloud logging read \
  "resource.type=cloud_run_job AND resource.labels.job_name=reel-stitching-job" \
  --limit=10 \
  --format=json
```

#### Step 5: Test Functionality
```bash
# Trigger a video stitching job to ensure no regression
# Use Phoenix Reel Maker interface or API endpoint
curl -X POST https://phoenix-app-url.com/api/video/stitch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"project_id": "test_project_id"}'
```

### Phase 3: Test Frontend Validation

#### Test Case 1: Normal Usage (Under Limit)
1. Open Reel Maker in browser
2. Navigate to prompt panel
3. Paste JSON array with 15 prompts
4. **Expected**: See "15/20 clips" in gray
5. Click "Save prompts"
6. **Expected**: Saves successfully

#### Test Case 2: Near Limit Warning
1. Paste JSON array with 18 prompts
2. **Expected**: See "18/20 clips" in yellow
3. **Expected**: See warning: "⚡ You're at the 20-clip limit..."
4. Click "Save prompts"
5. **Expected**: Saves successfully

#### Test Case 3: Exactly at Limit
1. Paste JSON array with exactly 20 prompts
2. **Expected**: See "20/20 clips" in yellow
3. Click "Save prompts"
4. **Expected**: Saves successfully

#### Test Case 4: Over Limit (Error)
1. Paste JSON array with 25 prompts
2. **Expected**: See "25/20 clips" in RED
3. **Expected**: Textarea has red border
4. **Expected**: Error message: "🎬 Please limit your video to 20 clips..."
5. Click "Save prompts"
6. **Expected**: Does NOT save, shows error
7. Remove prompts to get to 19
8. **Expected**: Error clears, normal state restored

#### Test Case 5: Real-Time Updates
1. Start with 15 prompts (gray)
2. Add 3 more in textarea (type or paste)
3. **Expected**: Counter updates to "18/20 clips" (yellow)
4. Add 3 more
5. **Expected**: Counter updates to "21/20 clips" (red + border)
6. Delete prompts back to 17
7. **Expected**: Returns to gray, error clears

### Phase 4: Build Frontend for Production

```bash
cd frontend/reel-maker
npm run build
# Or however you build the React app for Phoenix
```

**Verify Build**:
```bash
# Check that build directory exists with updated component
ls -lh build/
```

### Phase 5: Deploy to Production

```bash
# Option A: Automated deployment (if frontend is part of main app)
git add frontend/reel-maker/src/components/PromptPanel.tsx
git commit -m "feat(reel-maker): add 20-clip limit validation with friendly messaging"
git push origin main

# Option B: Manual deployment
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Trigger Not Created
**Symptom**: Command fails with permission error  
**Solution**:
```bash
# Grant Cloud Build service account necessary permissions
PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe phoenix-project-386 --format="value(projectNumber)")
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding phoenix-project-386 \
  --member="serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/run.admin"
```

### Issue: Trigger Doesn't Activate
**Symptom**: Push to main doesn't start build  
**Check**:
1. Verify file changes are in `jobs/video_stitching/` directory
2. Check trigger status: `gcloud builds triggers describe reel-stitching-job-deploy`
3. Ensure trigger is not disabled
4. Verify GitHub connection in Cloud Console

### Issue: Build Fails
**Symptom**: Build status shows FAILURE  
**Debug**:
```bash
# Get build ID
BUILD_ID=$(gcloud builds list --limit=1 --format="value(id)")

# View full logs
gcloud builds log $BUILD_ID

# Common issues:
# - Dockerfile not found: Check path in cloudbuild.yaml
# - Image push failed: Check GCR permissions
# - Deployment failed: Check Cloud Run Job exists
```

### Issue: Frontend Validation Not Working
**Symptom**: Counter doesn't update or validation doesn't trigger  
**Debug**:
1. Open browser DevTools console
2. Check for JavaScript errors
3. Verify PromptPanel.tsx compiled correctly
4. Check that React state updates are firing
5. Ensure `promptCount` useMemo is calculating correctly

### Issue: Build Takes Too Long
**Symptom**: Build exceeds 10 minutes  
**Solution**:
```yaml
# In cloudbuild.yaml, increase timeout
timeout: '1800s'  # 30 minutes instead of default

# Or use faster machine type
options:
  machineType: 'E2_HIGHCPU_8'
```
