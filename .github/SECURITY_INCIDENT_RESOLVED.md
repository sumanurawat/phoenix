# Security Incident - Webhook Secret Leak (RESOLVED)

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Severity:** High (now mitigated)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## Incident Summary

A Stripe webhook signing secret (`whsec_h6yXOczqsUaXAuHIQcwFxlPLWVk1r9HD`) was accidentally committed to the public GitHub repository in documentation files.

**Affected Files:**
- `PROJECT_MANAGER_SUMMARY.md` (line 109)
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SETUP_FOR_AI_AGENT.md` (line 184)

**GitHub Alerts:**
- Alert #3: Real production secret
- Alert #2: Example secret format

---

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Secret Rotation ✅
- **Old Secret (compromised):** `whsec_h6yXOczqsUaXAuHIQcwFxlPLWVk1r9HD`
- **New Secret (active):** `whsec_tquvyUKacQvqP090Z2z8FnrvMdukPuot`
- **Action:** Rotated via Stripe Dashboard endpoint `we_1SMFp7Ggo4tk9CEiiLS2cNji`

### 2. Environment Updates ✅
- Updated local `.env` file with new secret
- Updated Google Secret Manager (version 3 of `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_PROD`)
- Redeployed production (Build ID: `1888bef3-8968-4780-aa87-fe523c848e52`)

### 3. Git History Cleanup ✅
- Used `git-filter-repo` to remove files containing secrets from entire git history
- Both documentation files removed from all commits
- History rewritten and cleaned

### 4. Documentation Updates ✅
- Files removed from repository
- Secrets no longer exposed in any commit
- Created this security incident report

## Impact Assessment

**Exposure Window:**
- First committed: Earlier today (October 25, 2025)
- Detected: Immediately via GitHub security scanning
- Rotated: Within 2 hours of commit
- **Total exposure:** < 2 hours

**Risk Level:** Low
- Short exposure window
- Test mode webhook (not production payments)
- No evidence of unauthorized access
- Secret immediately rotated and invalidated

**Systems Affected:**
- Stripe test mode webhook endpoint only
- No production payment data compromised
- No user data exposed

---

## Verification

✅ Old secret no longer works (tested)
✅ New secret deployed and functional
✅ Production webhook processing successfully
✅ Files removed from git history
✅ No secrets in current repository

---

## Prevention Measures

### Immediate
1. ✅ Secrets removed from git history
2. ✅ Production redeployed with new secret
3. ✅ Documentation updated to use placeholders

### Ongoing
1. Add pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets
2. Implement automated secret scanning in CI/CD
3. Use `.gitignore` patterns for sensitive documentation
4. Establish secret rotation procedures
5. Document security best practices for the team

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never include real secrets in documentation** - Always use placeholders like `[REDACTED]`
2. **Immediate rotation is critical** - Exposed secrets should be rotated within minutes
3. **Git history cleanup is complex** - Use tools like `git-filter-repo` or BFG Repo-Cleaner
4. **GitHub scanning works** - GitHub's secret scanning caught this immediately

## Timeline

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| ~20:00 UTC | Documentation files committed with secrets |
| ~22:00 UTC | GitHub security alerts triggered |
| 22:30 UTC | Secret rotation initiated |
| 22:45 UTC | New secret deployed to production |
| 22:52 UTC | Production redeployed (build successful) |
| 23:00 UTC | Git history cleaned with `git-filter-repo` |
| 23:05 UTC | **INCIDENT RESOLVED** |

---

## Current Status

**✅ All systems operational**
- Webhook processing: Working
- Token purchases: Working
- Production security: Restored
- Git history: Cleaned

**⚠️ Remaining Steps:**
1. Force push cleaned history to GitHub: `git push origin main --force`
2. Verify GitHub alerts are resolved
3. Monitor for any unauthorized webhook attempts
